    "By writing a string literal as the first statement in the function",

explanation = """
    Docstrings document functions and other Python objects. A docstring is a
    string literal that occurs as the first statement in a module, function,
    class, or method definition. Such a docstring becomes the .__doc__ special
    attribute of that object. See PEP 257 for more information.

    There's no built-in @docstring decorator. Many functions naturally return
    strings. Such a feature can therefore not be used for docstrings.
